2. 5.4km. 这周实验室的作息是朝九晚十一乘以七，除去两个下午睡觉外。因为寝室和实验室都在五楼，正常来回运动量为每天20层楼 + 4km走路。勉勉强强算另一个workout。Plus, 电路硬件调试基本完成，花了一周，效率还是低。
3. 预约失败。我以为我预约了，其实没有。

Zoey's Status:
1. Cards done https://github.com/zoeyzoey0102/Liberal-Arts/issues/7 Honestly, the first chapter turns out to be a lot beyond my comprehension for now. failed in the attempt to figure out a theoretical framework on this chapter. Yet despite of everything, I was still captivated all along by his aesthetic pursuit as a scholarly man in the world of social science. 
2. Reconsidering _Time_ https://www.douban.com/note/614332843/

Zoey's Status:        
It's been an eventful week both in terms of work and personal life. I've been offered a gracious opportunity to go on a bz trip to the US and am still in the process of Visa application. If everything turns out smoothly, I'll be landing in America no later than 12 May. New York has always been my dream and I know I'll get there some day in the near future. However, I was not as excited as I should have been, because I found myself in love, which was too good to be true and totally beyond my plan. There's been realistic concern, and the two of us may not get the chance to see each other for the upcoming months. But Imagine and I have decided to be committed to this relationship because both of us know we can't afford to lose it.        
Now that I've got a boyfriend, my work and an ambitous reading schedule to focus on, I need some more time to get re-balanced and figure out a best practice to have everthing get on the right track.

This week has witnessed further development in relationship between us. We made our relationship public to close people, our parents and some of our friends. We rented an apartment in Shanghai period at Airbnb and spent almost the whole three days indoor. We hanged in the street, book store, library, mirrors near the washroom and made love at midnight and mid afternoon. We finally have string bracelet as our token of attachment after visiting every ring store near the apartment before Zoey's departure for US for 3 months next week. May Zoey will deserve what she does and have a good time there. May the best wishes to our relationship.
I did do a lot of efficient work in the weekdays before our meet in Shanghai, certainly mostly the lab work. As so far a good sleeping is still a career to be catched up. Workout output just meets the quota, 4km at 4/20/2017 and 8.26km at 4/24. The book has not been finished and not to say the essay. 读书会没有举行。 And some workload also gived to application matter of the RWTH Aahen Univ. exchange program.
