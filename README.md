1. Done. Actually every morning I wake up earlier than my alarm through this week, lol.
2. 5.4km. 这周实验室的作息是朝九晚十一乘以七，除去两个下午睡觉外。因为寝室和实验室都在五楼，正常来回运动量为每天20层楼 + 4km走路。勉勉强强算另一个workout。Plus, 电路硬件调试基本完成，花了一周，效率还是低。
3. 预约失败。我以为我预约了，其实没有。

Zoey's Status:
1. Cards done https://github.com/zoeyzoey0102/Liberal-Arts/issues/7 Honestly, the first chapter turns out to be a lot beyond my comprehension for now. failed in the attempt to figure out a theoretical framework on this chapter. Yet despite of everything, I was still captivated all along by his aesthetic pursuit as a scholarly man in the world of social science. 
2. Reconsidering *Time* https://www.douban.com/note/614332843/        
3. 3/4 skipped as non-compulsory
